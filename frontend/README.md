# Frontend README for the React.js Application

# My Mobile App Frontend

This is the frontend part of the My Mobile App project, built using React.js. It communicates with the FastAPI backend to provide a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-mobile-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   Start the development server with:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file for the React application.
- `src/App.js`: The main component that sets up the application structure.
- `src/index.js`: The entry point for the React application.
- `src/components/UserComponent.js`: A component for displaying user information.
- `src/services/api.js`: Functions for making API calls to the backend.

## API Integration

The frontend interacts with the backend REST API to fetch and manipulate user data. Ensure that the backend is running before testing the frontend features.
